# Land Regeneration Tracker

This project develops a machine learning model to track land regeneration 
using geospatial and metagenomic data. The model focuses on assessing 
regenerative practices in land plots, including carbon sequestration, 
soil and water quality, and biodiversity.

## Description

The project utilizes machine learning algorithms, including Random 
Forest, to analyze and predict the effectiveness of regenerative 
practices. Geospatial data and metagenomic information form the basis of 
our analysis, enabling a comprehensive understanding of the ecological 
impact of these practices.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

- Python 3.12.0 or higher
- Libraries: Flask, Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Joblib
- A basic understanding of machine learning concepts and geospatial 
analysis.

### Installing

- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Install the required Python libraries:
  ```bash
  pip install flask numpy pandas scikit-learn joblib
Executing the program
Activate your Python virtual environment.
Navigate to the project directory and run the Flask application:
bash
Copy code
python app.py
Access the application through your browser or API testing tool at 
http://127.0.0.1:5000.
How it Works
The application uses a trained Random Forest model to predict the 
regenerative potential of a land plot based on input geospatial and 
metagenomic data. The model's prediction gives an indication of the land 
plot's health and its suitability for various regenerative practices.
